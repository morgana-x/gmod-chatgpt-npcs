# gmod-chatgpt-npcs
Type: openai_key YOURKEYHERE  
in the server console in order for this to work

An addon that adds chatgpt to npcs. They react to being shot and capable of responding to player and each other etc. (Not just some respond to prompt thing like I saw on youtube) Has awful code made at 3 am but it works for the purposes desired. 

Do note that this could use alot of openai credit/usage/money  depending on how you use it so be mindful that the prompts being sent are inefficent to say the least
